# üöÄ GitHub + Netlify Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ Status: Local Git Repository Ready!
Your HealthVolt project is now initialized with Git and ready to be pushed to GitHub.

## üìã Next Steps (Follow in Order)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: [github.com](https://github.com)
2. **Sign in** to your GitHub account (or create one if needed)
3. **Click the green "New" button** or go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
4. **Repository settings**:
   - **Repository name**: `healthvolt` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Description**: `Smart Health Records Management System`
   - **Visibility**: Choose **Public** or **Private**
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
5. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: Push Your Code to GitHub

GitHub will show you commands, but here's what you need to run in your PowerShell:

```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace with YOUR repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/healthvolt.git

# Rename branch to main (GitHub's default)
git branch -M main

# Push your code
git push -u origin main
```

**Important**: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username!

### Step 3: Connect to Netlify

1. **Go to Netlify**: [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. **Sign up/Login** (you can use your GitHub account for easy integration)
3. **Click "New site from Git"**
4. **Choose "GitHub"** as your Git provider
5. **Authorize Netlify** to access your GitHub repositories
6. **Select your `healthvolt` repository**
7. **Configure build settings** (these should auto-detect):
   - **Branch to deploy**: `main`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
8. **Click "Deploy site"**

### Step 4: Add Environment Variables to Netlify

After deployment, you MUST add environment variables:

1. **Go to your site dashboard** in Netlify
2. **Click "Site settings"**
3. **Click "Environment variables"** in the sidebar
4. **Click "Add variable"** and add these two:

```
Variable 1:
Key: VITE_SUPABASE_URL
Value: https://mrltorlzehiiqreyluwv.supabase.co

Variable 2:
Key: VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
Value: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im1ybHRvcmx6ZWhpaXFyZXlsdXd2Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTYzODcxMDIsImV4cCI6MjA3MTk2MzEwMn0.4iPNuIcgRtHEQ2Ks289c5LabkMOiLr9OyTyRLW4O_hQ
```

5. **Save the variables**
6. **Trigger a redeploy**: Go to "Deploys" ‚Üí "Trigger deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy site"

## üéâ What You'll Get

Once completed, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ **Live website** with a Netlify URL (e.g., `https://amazing-name-12345.netlify.app`)
- ‚úÖ **Automatic deployments** - every push to GitHub triggers a new deployment
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS certificate** - automatically provided
- ‚úÖ **Global CDN** - fast loading worldwide
- ‚úÖ **Branch deployments** - test features before merging

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment Workflow

After setup, your workflow becomes:
1. Make changes to your code
2. `git add .` ‚Üí `git commit -m "description"` ‚Üí `git push`
3. Netlify automatically builds and deploys your changes
4. Your live site updates in 2-3 minutes

## ‚è±Ô∏è Expected Timeline
- GitHub repository creation: 2 minutes
- Pushing code: 1 minute
- Netlify connection: 3 minutes
- Environment variables: 2 minutes
- **Total**: ~8 minutes to go live!

## üÜò Need Help?
- GitHub not working? Check your username in the remote URL
- Build failing? Check that environment variables are set correctly
- Site not loading? Check the deploy logs in Netlify dashboard

## üì± Test Your Deployed App
Once live, test these features:
- [ ] User registration/login
- [ ] Patient dashboard loads
- [ ] File upload works
- [ ] Hospital dashboard accessible
- [ ] Delete functionality works
