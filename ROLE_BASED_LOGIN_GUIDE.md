# Role-Based Login Implementation

## Overview
This implementation enforces role-based login restrictions where:
- **Patients** can only login through the Patient tab
- **Hospital/Doctor staff** can only login through the Hospital tab

## How It Works

### 1. Role-Specific Authentication Functions
- `signInAsPatient()` - Validates that the user has a 'patient' role
- `signInAsHospital()` - Validates that the user has a 'hospital' role

### 2. Validation Process
1. User enters credentials and selects a tab (Patient or Hospital)
2. System attempts authentication with Supabase
3. After successful authentication, system checks user's actual role in database
4. If role doesn't match the selected tab:
   - User is automatically signed out
   - Appropriate error message is displayed
5. If role matches, user is signed in successfully

### 3. Error Messages
- **Patient trying to login via Hospital tab**: 
  > "This account is not registered as a hospital/doctor. Please use the Patient tab to login."
  
- **Hospital staff trying to login via Patient tab**: 
  > "This account is not registered as a patient. Please use the Hospital tab to login."

## Files Modified

### 1. `/src/services/api.ts`
- Added `signInAsPatient()` function
- Added `signInAsHospital()` function
- Both functions validate user role and sign out if role mismatch

### 2. `/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added `signInAsPatient` method to context interface
- Added `signInAsHospital` method to context interface
- Implemented both methods in AuthProvider

### 3. `/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx`
- Modified `handleLogin()` to use role-specific signin methods
- Uses `signInAsPatient()` when Patient tab is selected
- Uses `signInAsHospital()` when Hospital tab is selected

## Testing the Implementation

### Test Case 1: Patient Login via Patient Tab ✅
1. Select "Patient" tab
2. Enter patient credentials
3. Should login successfully

### Test Case 2: Hospital Login via Hospital Tab ✅  
1. Select "Hospital" tab
2. Enter hospital/doctor credentials
3. Should login successfully

### Test Case 3: Patient Login via Hospital Tab ❌
1. Select "Hospital" tab
2. Enter patient credentials
3. Should show error: "This account is not registered as a hospital/doctor..."

### Test Case 4: Hospital Login via Patient Tab ❌
1. Select "Patient" tab  
2. Enter hospital/doctor credentials
3. Should show error: "This account is not registered as a patient..."

## Security Benefits
- **Prevents unauthorized access**: Users cannot accidentally or intentionally access wrong dashboard
- **Clear role separation**: Maintains clear boundaries between patient and hospital interfaces
- **User experience**: Provides clear feedback when users select wrong login type
- **Data protection**: Ensures sensitive medical data is only accessible by appropriate user types
